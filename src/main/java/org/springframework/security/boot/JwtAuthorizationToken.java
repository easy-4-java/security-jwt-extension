/**
 * Spring Security {@link AbstractAuthenticationToken} that represents an
 * already-authorized JWT principal.
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link JwtAuthenticationToken}, which is created from the raw
 * credentials of an authentication attempt, this token is produced when the
 * framework already trusts the principal &mdash; typically when a stateless
 * service decodes a previously issued JWT and simply needs to thread the
 * associated identity through the {@code SecurityContext}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The token is structurally identical to {@link JwtAuthenticationToken}
 * but its lifecycle is slightly different: the second constructor will erase
 * any credentials it receives, mirroring the convention used by
 * {@code UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken}'s trusted-constructor pattern.</p>
 *
 * <p>The optional {@link #sign}, {@link #longitude} and {@link #latitude}
 * fields allow the request to carry replay-protection and geo-location hints
 * that downstream authorization filters can inspect.</p>
