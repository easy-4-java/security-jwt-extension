/**
 * Spring Security {@link AbstractAuthenticationToken} carrying the
 * authentication-time credentials of a JSON Web Token (JWT) login attempt.
 *
 * <p>This token is produced by the JWT authentication entry-point and is
 * consumed by an {@code AuthenticationManager} (or a dedicated
 * {@code AuthenticationProvider}). Its lifecycle mirrors the canonical
 * {@code UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken}: an unauthenticated instance is
 * built from the raw request payload, then a second authenticated instance
 * is constructed by the manager once the JWT signature has been validated
 * and the principal has been resolved.</p>
 *
 * <p>In addition to the standard principal/credentials pair, the token
 * carries a few optional request-side hints:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #sign} &mdash; the request parameter signature used by the
 *       replay-protection layer;</li>
 *   <li>{@link #longitude} / {@link #latitude} &mdash; the latest known
 *       geo-location of the user device, which may be validated by a
 *       location-aware authentication provider.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For authorization flows that only require a principal (already trusted),
 * prefer {@link JwtAuthorizationToken}.</p>
