/**
 * JWT authorization success handler invoked by Spring Security after a JWT
 * authentication attempt has successfully resolved a principal.
 *
 * <p>This handler is intentionally lightweight: it does not write any
 * response body or redirect the caller, because the surrounding filter
 * chain typically returns the bearer token directly in the response. Its
 * sole responsibility is to remove any temporary authentication-related
 * attributes that Spring Security may have stored in the {@link HttpSession}
 * during the authentication process &mdash; most notably the
 * {@link WebAttributes#AUTHENTICATION_EXCEPTION} attribute.</p>
 *
 * <p>The handler is safe to use in stateless deployments: when no session
 * exists for the request, {@link #clearAuthenticationAttributes(HttpServletRequest)}
 * is a no-op.</p>
